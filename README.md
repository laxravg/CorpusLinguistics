## Project Overview

This project leverages **Digital Humanities** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze the language and themes of the African American Civil Rights Movement. By applying *distant reading* techniques, it explores the fight against racial segregation in the United States through two key corpora:

- **Colored Conventions Project (CCP):** Documents from Black conventions held between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, organized by free Black community leaders in the North.
- **Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Speeches:** A collection of 11 speeches from the 1950s and 1960s, focused on racial equality, social justice, and nonviolent resistance.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main scripts and data folders:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing raw text data, including stopword and punctuation removal using spaCy.
- **XML Conversion:** Transforming cleaned texts into XML format with metadata, POS tags, and named entity annotations.
- **Collocation Analysis:** Extracting and analyzing frequent word pairs (*bigrams*) from the corpora.
- **NER Analysis:** Identifying and counting the most frequent named entities, excluding numbers and locations.
- **Topic Modeling:** Filtering tokens by grammatical category and entity type, segmenting texts, and applying the BERTopic model.

---

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Used `spaCy` (`en_core_web_sm`) to clean texts by removing stopwords and punctuation.

2. **XML Conversion:**
   - Converted texts to XML.
   - Extracted metadata and annotated with POS tags and named entities.

3. **Collocation Analysis:**
   - Extracted tokens from XML.
   - Generated bigrams and identified the most frequent collocations in each corpus.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
   - Identified the 20 most frequent named entities.
   - Filtered out numbers and locations to focus on relevant people, organizations, and concepts.

5. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Filtered for nouns, adjectives, proper nouns, and relevant named entities.
   - Segmented data into smaller documents.
   - Applied `BERTopic` to extract and compare core topics in MLK and CCP texts.
